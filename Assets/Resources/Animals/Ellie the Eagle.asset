  strDanger: Ellie flew into a power line, breaking her wing and losing her ability
    to fly.
  strStry: "\"Ellie's Skyfall\" Ellie soared through the skies, her wings spread
    wide as she watched over her territory from above. One day, as she was diving
    towards her nest, she struck a power line that was hidden against the bright
    sky. The impact broke her wing, and she spiraled to the ground, crashing into
    a nearby field. Unable to fly, Ellie lay there helpless, at risk from predators
    and starvation. A farmer found her the next day and contacted wildlife rescuers.
    They carefully transported Ellie to a sanctuary where her wing was treated. During
    her long recovery, Ellie\u2019s spirit remained strong. Her story serves as a
    reminder of the unseen dangers that human structures pose to birds of prey."
