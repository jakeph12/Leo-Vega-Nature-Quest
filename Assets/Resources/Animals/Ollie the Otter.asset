  strDanger: Ollie was found in a polluted river, his fur matted with oil, making
    it impossible for him to keep warm in the water.
  strStry: "\"Ollie's River Struggle\" Ollie was a joyful otter who spent his days
    swimming and playing in the river. One fateful day, a tanker spilled oil into
    his habitat, covering the water in a slick, dark sheen. Ollie, unaware of the
    danger, continued to swim until his fur became matted with oil. Unable to keep
    warm, he started to shiver uncontrollably. Ollie struggled to find food as the
    river's fish population dwindled due to the pollution. A wildlife rescue team
    discovered Ollie in his weakened state and brought him to safety. After many
    baths and care, Ollie\u2019s fur was finally clean, and he was able to swim and
    play again. His story is a powerful reminder of the impact of pollution on aquatic
    life."
