  strDanger: 'Rocky was found with an injured tail after narrowly escaping a predator. '
  strStry: '"Rocky''s Close Call" Rocky lived high up in the treetops, darting through
    the branches with agility. One day, while foraging for food, he was ambushed
    by a hawk. In his frantic escape, he fell, injuring his tail. Grounded and in
    pain, Rocky was left vulnerable to other predators. He managed to find a hiding
    spot under a fallen log, where he remained for days, too afraid to move. His
    tail, crucial for balance, hung limp. A kind hiker found him and brought him
    to the shelter. With care and patience, Rocky learned to adapt, his tail slowly
    regaining its strength. His story reminds us of the delicate balance of nature
    and the resilience of its creatures.'
