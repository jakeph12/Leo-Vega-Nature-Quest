  strDanger: Daisy was found injured by the roadside, possibly hit by a car while
    foraging at night.
  strStry: "\"Daisy's Brave Recovery\" Daisy was a curious little hedgehog who loved
    exploring the quiet countryside under the cover of night. One evening, while
    foraging for insects near the road, she was struck by a passing car. Dazed and
    in pain, she curled into a ball, her natural defense mechanism. But this time,
    it wasn\u2019t enough. She remained on the roadside, unable to move and at risk
    of further injury. A kind passerby found her the next morning and rushed her
    to a wildlife rescue center. Daisy's story is a poignant reminder of the dangers
    wildlife face from human infrastructure, and the importance of mindful driving
    in areas where animals roam. "
