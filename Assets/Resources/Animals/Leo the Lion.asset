  strDanger: Leo was found orphaned, wandering alone in the savannah after his pride
    was killed by poachers.
  strStry: '"Leo''s Brave Heart" Leo was born into a majestic pride that ruled the
    savannah. But tragedy struck when poachers attacked, leaving him alone and orphaned.
    Too young to fend for himself, Leo wandered the plains, searching for his family.
    His cries echoed in the emptiness of the savannah. Hungry and scared, he found
    shelter under a bush, surviving on scraps. Days turned into weeks, and just as
    hope began to fade, he was found by rescuers. They took him in, giving him the
    care and protection he needed. Leo''s story is a stark reminder of the dangers
    that poachers pose to wildlife and the importance of conservation. '
