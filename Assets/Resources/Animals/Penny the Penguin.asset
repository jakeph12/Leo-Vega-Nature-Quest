  strDanger: Penny was found covered in oil after an offshore spill near her colony,
    struggling to move and keep warm.
  strStry: "\"Penny's Ocean Ordeal\" Penny was a happy penguin, thriving in the cold
    waters with her colony. But one day, an offshore oil spill polluted the ocean,
    covering everything in a thick, dark layer. Penny swam through the oily waters,
    unaware of the danger. Soon, her feathers became coated with oil, making it impossible
    for her to keep warm or float properly. She struggled back to shore, exhausted
    and shivering. A rescue team arrived, finding Penny among the rocks, covered
    in oil. They quickly transported her to a marine rescue center where she underwent
    a lengthy cleaning process. Penny\u2019s story raises awareness about the devastating
    impact of oil spills on marine life and the urgent need for environmental protection."
