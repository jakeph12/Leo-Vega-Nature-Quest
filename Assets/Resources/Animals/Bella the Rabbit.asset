  strDanger: Bella was kept in a tiny cage in an illegal pet trade operation.
  strStry: '"Bella''s Liberation" Bella''s world was confined to a small wire cage,
    barely large enough for her to turn around. She was part of an illegal pet trade,
    kept in darkness with no room to hop or stretch her legs. Her fur became matted,
    and her spirit dulled. Days turned into weeks, and Bella had almost forgotten
    what freedom felt like. Then, during a raid, the operation was shut down, and
    Bella was rescued. She hesitated at first, not knowing what it meant to be free.
    But with time, she learned to hop again, her eyes brightening as she explored
    her new surroundings. Bella''s story is a stark reminder of the cruelty of the
    illegal pet trade and the importance of animal rescue.'
