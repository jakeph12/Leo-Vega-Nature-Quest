  strDanger: Piper was rescued from an illegal smuggling operation, kept in a tiny
    cage.
  strStry: '"Piper''s Voice Returns" Piper''s colors were as vibrant as her spirit.
    But when she was captured by smugglers, her world turned dark. Forced into a
    tiny cage with barely enough room to spread her wings, Piper''s lively chirps
    turned to silence. Days turned into weeks, and she grew weak and scared. Her
    beautiful feathers became dull, and her once bright eyes lost their shine. During
    a raid, she was freed, but the road to recovery was long. Slowly, Piper began
    to trust again, her voice returning with every passing day. She now sings freely,
    reminding everyone of the joy that freedom brings to every living being. '
