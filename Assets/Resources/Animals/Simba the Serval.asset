  strDanger: Simba was rescued from the illegal exotic pet trade, where he was kept
    in a small cage and denied proper care.
  strStry: '"Simba''s Path to Freedom" Simba was born in the wild, a majestic serval
    destined to roam the grasslands. However, he was captured by poachers and sold
    into the exotic pet trade. He spent his early life confined to a small, dirty
    cage, denied the freedom and space he needed. His natural instincts were suppressed,
    and he became malnourished and sickly. The only world Simba knew was the metal
    bars that confined him. During a raid on an illegal pet operation, authorities
    discovered Simba and brought him to a wildlife sanctuary. There, he received
    proper care and slowly began to rediscover his wild spirit. Simba''s story sheds
    light on the cruelty of the exotic pet trade and the importance of protecting
    wildlife from exploitation.'
