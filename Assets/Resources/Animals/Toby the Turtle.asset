  strDanger: Toby was found in the ocean, struggling with a plastic ring stuck around
    his shell, affecting his mobility.
  strStry: '"Toby''s Ocean Struggle" Toby was a sea turtle who loved the vast ocean.
    One day, while swimming near the surface, he got caught in a plastic ring that
    had been carelessly discarded into the sea. The ring wrapped around his shell,
    restricting his movement and making it difficult for him to dive or surface for
    air. Toby struggled for days, growing weaker and more vulnerable to predators.
    A group of divers spotted him and carefully removed the ring, bringing him to
    a marine rescue center. With care and nourishment, Toby slowly regained his strength.
    His story highlights the dire consequences of ocean pollution and the critical
    need to protect marine life.'
