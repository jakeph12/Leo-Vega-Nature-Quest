  strDanger: Hazel was caught in a wildfire in the forest, sustaining minor burns
    and losing her home in the process.
  strStry: '"Hazel''s Fire Escape" Hazel lived a quiet life in the forest, foraging
    for food at night and curling up safely during the day. One summer, a wildfire
    swept through the forest, turning her peaceful home into a blazing inferno. Hazel
    tried to escape the flames, but her small size made her especially vulnerable.
    She scurried through the underbrush, feeling the heat singe her quills and scorch
    her tiny feet. Finally, she found shelter in a hollow log, but the damage was
    done. The fire passed, leaving a charred landscape in its wake, and Hazel emerged,
    injured and without a home. Rescuers found her and brought her to safety, treating
    her burns and providing a new environment. Hazel''s story is a testament to the
    resilience of nature and the devastating effects of forest fires.'
