  strDanger: Zara was found alone on the plains after her herd was scattered by poachers,
    leaving her vulnerable to predators.
  strStry: '"Zara''s Lone Journey" Zara was part of a large zebra herd that roamed
    the African savannah. One day, poachers targeted her herd, scattering the group
    in chaos. In the confusion, Zara became separated from her family. She wandered
    the plains alone, constantly on alert for predators. Without the protection of
    her herd, Zara faced the harsh reality of the wild. Her stripes, once a source
    of security among her family, now made her an easy target. After days of solitary
    travel, she was found by a wildlife rescue team who took her to a sanctuary for
    safety and care. Zara''s story is a reminder of the ongoing threats of poaching
    and the importance of efforts to protect endangered species and their habitats.'
