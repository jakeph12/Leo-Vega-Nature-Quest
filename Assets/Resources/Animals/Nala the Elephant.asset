  strDanger: Nala was separated from her herd during a drought and found wandering
    alone.
  strStry: '"Nala''s Lonely Journey" Nala was a young elephant, always protected
    by the strength of her herd. But during a severe drought, resources became scarce,
    and the herd was forced to move in search of water. In the chaos, Nala got separated
    from the group. She wandered alone through the arid landscape, her small trunk
    searching for water and comfort. Days turned into an endless search, and Nala
    grew weak. Just when her strength was about to fail, she was found by a rescue
    team. They provided her with water and care, bringing her to a safe sanctuary.
    Nala''s story is a reminder of the challenges faced by wildlife due to climate
    change and habitat loss.'
