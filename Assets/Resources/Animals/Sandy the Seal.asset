  strDanger: Sandy was entangled in a fishing net in the ocean, struggling to swim
    and at risk of drowning.
  strStry: '"Sandy''s Sea Escape" Sandy was a playful seal who spent her days diving
    and chasing fish in the ocean. One day, while swimming near the shore, she got
    caught in a discarded fishing net. The more she struggled, the tighter the net
    became, restricting her movements and threatening to drag her underwater. Sandy
    managed to surface for air, but she was getting weaker with each attempt to free
    herself. Fortunately, a group of fishermen spotted her struggle and called for
    help. Rescuers arrived quickly, carefully cutting the net and freeing Sandy.
    After her rescue, Sandy was taken to a marine sanctuary where she received care
    and rehabilitation. Her story highlights the dangers of marine debris and the
    importance of keeping our oceans clean.'
