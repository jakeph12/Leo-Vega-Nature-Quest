  strDanger: Misty was found lost and injured in the forest after becoming disoriented
    and separated from her herd.
  strStry: '"Misty''s Forest Adventure" Misty was a gentle giant, roaming the vast
    forests with her herd. One winter, during a heavy snowstorm, Misty became separated
    from the others. Disoriented and unable to find her way back, she wandered deeper
    into the forest, her legs growing weary from the thick snow. In her search for
    her herd, Misty slipped on an icy patch and injured her leg. She lay there, unable
    to move, as the cold seeped into her bones. Days later, hikers found her and
    alerted wildlife rescuers. They helped Misty to a sanctuary where she was cared
    for and her leg treated. Misty''s story is a reminder of the challenges animals
    face due to extreme weather and habitat changes.'
