  strDanger: Ruby was found in a deforested area, her habitat destroyed by human
    activity, leaving her homeless.
  strStry: '"Ruby''s Lost Home" Ruby lived high up in the trees of a lush forest,
    her days filled with climbing and foraging for bamboo. One day, she awoke to
    the sound of chainsaws and the smell of smoke. Her forest home was being destroyed,
    and with nowhere to go, Ruby wandered into an open area, confused and frightened.
    For days, she searched for shelter, her once vibrant coat growing dull from hunger
    and stress. It was a wildlife rescue team that finally found her, hiding in the
    remains of what used to be her home. They brought her to a sanctuary, where Ruby
    slowly adapted to her new surroundings. Her story raises awareness about deforestation
    and its impact on the animals that lose their homes.'
