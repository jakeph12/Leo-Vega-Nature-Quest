  strDanger: Finn was found with his legs entangled in plastic waste near a polluted
    lake, making it difficult for him to walk or wade in the water.
  strStry: '"Finn''s Polluted Waters" Finn was a graceful flamingo who spent his
    days wading in the clear waters of the lake. However, as pollution increased,
    the once-pristine lake became a dumping ground for plastic waste. One day, while
    foraging, Finn''s legs got entangled in a mass of plastic. He tried to free himself,
    but the plastic only tightened, cutting into his legs and making it impossible
    for him to walk or swim properly. Weak and unable to find food, Finn stood helplessly
    by the lake''s edge. Thankfully, a group of volunteers spotted him and carefully
    removed the plastic. Finn was taken to a bird sanctuary where his wounds were
    treated. His story serves as a sobering reminder of the environmental impact
    of pollution and the urgent need for wildlife conservation.'
