  strDanger: Jack was stranded on the shore, tangled in plastic waste and unable
    to return to the ocean.
  strStry: '"Jack''s Ocean Rescue" Jack was a playful dolphin who loved riding the
    ocean waves with his pod. One day, while swimming near the coast, he got entangled
    in plastic waste. The debris wrapped around his fins, making it impossible for
    him to swim properly. He struggled to free himself, but his efforts only made
    the situation worse. Exhausted, Jack was washed ashore by the tide. It was there
    that he was found by beachgoers, struggling for breath. Rescuers were called
    in, and they carefully cut away the plastic, freeing Jack. After receiving care,
    Jack was finally released back into the ocean, a reminder of the dire impact
    of ocean pollution on marine life.'
