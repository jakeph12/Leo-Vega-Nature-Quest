  strDanger: Stella got caught in a discarded fishing net while swimming in a polluted
    lake, unable to free herself.
  strStry: "\"Stella's Grace Restored\" Stella was known for her grace, gliding effortlessly
    across the lake\u2019s surface. One morning, as she swam near the shore, she
    became tangled in a fishing net left behind by careless fishermen. The net wrapped
    around her wings, restricting her movement and cutting into her skin. Stella
    struggled to break free, but every movement only tightened the net. She became
    exhausted and started losing her strength. A passerby noticed her distress and
    called for help. Rescuers carefully cut Stella free and brought her to safety.
    Over time, her wounds healed, and Stella learned to trust the water again. Her
    story highlights the dangers of pollution and carelessness in our natural environments."
